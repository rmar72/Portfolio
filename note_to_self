Instructions to use this project

1  npm install
1.5  npm i -g node-sass, since sass will require it (look at json file, what the first command is)

a) After that to view the project open the index.html page with a quick server like from VScode or a NPM ready to use nodejs server
b) Open scss directory in a terminal and run - npm run sass    ... this will go into hot-reload mode waiting for any changes done to files in the scss dir

Master branch is not the branch github pages is using but rather the gh-pages branch.
So when done making new changes, copy xyz file(s) and make the proper replacement into the gh-pages branch
